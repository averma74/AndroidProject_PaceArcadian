List of Features

Login/Registration - Users should be able to create an account for your application and log into their account once they’ve registered.

User Profile - Each user should have a profile. At a bare minimum, it should contain the user’s first name, last name, email address, graduation year and their reputation on the app.

Inventory - Each user should have access to an inventory screen where they can add and remove items or services that they have available to trade. This screen’s level of sophistication is up to you. You can either have users enter in inventory items manually or have a predefined list of items they can choose from. If the item being traded for is something that can only be used once and not be re-traded (i.e. concert tickets), then the item should be marked as “Out of Stock” in the user’s inventory when it is traded. If the item is something that can be re-traded later, it should be transferred from the initial user’s inventory to the inventory of the new user.

Trade Feed - A standard, scrollable feed that lists item that are currently available to be traded for.

Follow/Unfollow - Provide an ability to the user, to follow or unfollow other users. Also there will be push notification if the user starts following the another user.
